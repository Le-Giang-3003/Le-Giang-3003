### Hi, I'm Lê Giang

🌱 I’m currently studying **Software Engineering** at FPT University, Ho Chi Minh.  
💻 I mainly work with **.NET / C#**, and I enjoy building applications with clean architecture and good practices.  

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **.NET projects** and open-source contributions.  
🎮 In my free time, I love playing video games — feel free to connect with me on **[Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/76561199210962425)**!
