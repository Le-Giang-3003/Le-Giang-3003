### Hi, I'm LÃª Giang

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying **Software Engineering** at FPT University, Ho Chi Minh.  
ðŸ’» I mainly work with **.NET / C#**, and I enjoy building applications with clean architecture and good practices.  

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **.NET projects** and open-source contributions.  
ðŸŽ® In my free time, I love playing video games â€” feel free to connect with me on **[Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/76561199210962425)**!
